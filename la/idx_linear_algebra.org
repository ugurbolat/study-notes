Set $U$ which is a subset of set $V$ is called subspace when it also has operations (i.e., addition $+$ and multiplication $\cdot$) and conditions (i.e., axioms/properties) that makes them a [[id:20240124T154925.829111][Vector Spaces]] and when it satisfies the following properties:

1. additive identity
2. closed under multiplication
3. closed under scalar multiplication

The set of *all* [[id:20240124T154932.833149][Linear Combinations]] of a list of vectors $\ket{v_1}, ... , \ket{v_n}$ in [[id:20240124T154925.829111][Vector Space]] $V$ is called the span of $\ket{v_1}, ... , \ket{v_n}$ denoted by $\operatorname{span} ( \ket{v_1}, ... , \ket{v_n})$. In other words,

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{span}\left(v_1, \ldots, v_m\right)=\left\{a_1 v_1+\cdots+a_m v_m: a_1, \ldots, a_m \in \mathbf{F}\right\}

A spanning set is a set of vectors $\set{ \ket{v_1}, ..., \ket{v_n} } \in V$ such that we can write any vector $\ket{v}$ in that vector space $V$ as linear combinations of those vectors $\ket{v} = \sum_{i} c_i \ket{v_i}$ where $c_i \in F$


The span of $S$ is a subspace of $V$.?
